<h1>Oga&rsquo;s Cantina</h1>
<h2>Behind The Music</h2>
</div>
</div>



<div class="content">

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>If you're fascinated by who on Earth actually creates songs in the voices of jawas and droids, this is a compendium of information on the artists who created the music that plays in Oga's Cantina in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.
	
<p>For those who haven't heard the music, 6 tracks were released in August 2019, and then the full "R3X's Playlist #1" with 18 tracks came out a month later.  The playlist is available for <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/star-wars-galaxys-edge-ogas-cantina-r3xs-playlist-1/1478016479">purchase</a>, and is also available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AydLFrcYNR8&list=PLiNVoBckLqLkZiHccDJk_lYiUrlESFO9z">YouTube</a> for the price of watching a few ads.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=9bd673e4-fd11-46e4-ae7c-bc9b87200d53">L.A. Times article</a>, 29 songs were commissioned.  3 unreleased tracks are available on the <a href="https://www.brewhousemusic.com/disneystarwarsdjr3xinogascan">Brewhouse Music site</a>.  So there are at least 8 more out there.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The primary architects of the project were two people at Walt Disney Imagineering, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-walker-4743111ba/"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a>
Matt Walker, the executive in charge of music, and
<a href="https://yaronspiwak.com/"><i class="fas fa-user"></i></a>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaron-spiwak-72496939/"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a>
Yaron Spiwak, a senior creative director.  The pair were interviewed by
<a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8528161/disneys-star-wars-galaxys-edge-cantina-music-album-playlist-one">Billboard</a> about the general strategy for the project.</p>

<p>Matt Walker also hosted an hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWWm8kUK-nc">panel discussion at D23 Expo 2019</a> about the music, featuring singer Judith Hill, Disney group songwriter Jason Mater, Matt Wood, a voiceover actor from Skywalker sound, and composer / producer Adam Dorn.</p>

Biola University Biography

Adam Gubman is a multimedia composer with a songsmith’s heart. He’s written melody-packed scores for feature films, theme park attractions, and more than 700 video games. He produced the smash anthem “This Is Me” from The Greatest Showman by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, which won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar and a Grammy. As a song producer, he’s lent his tune savviness to the films and television shows Baywatch, American Housewife, John Shaft, Ride Along, Galavant, The Smurfs, and Sausage Party, collaborating with composers such as Alan Menken, Aherns and Flaherty, Pasek and Paul, John Debney, and Christopher Lennertz.

In the gaming world, where he got his start on 2004’s Pirates of the Burning Sea, he’s run the gamut of genres with original score—and often original songs — for some of the biggest mobile games and publishing giants like Blizzard, Ubisoft, Sony Online Interactive, Electronic Arts, and Disney Online Interactive. He’s also created dozens of songs and arrangements for the magic-makers at Disney Imagineering for Disneyland, Disney World, and the Tokyo Disney properties, including Star Wars Galaxy Edge, Baymax Happy Ride and many more.

<h3>Further Listening</h3>

<p>R3X's Playlist includes a remix of Cantina Band, the most recognizable of John Williams&rsquo; compositions for the Star Wars movies.  But that is just one of the many pieces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Star_Wars#Diegetic_music">diagetic music</a> in the movies.  There is plenty more where that came from.  There are 4 other pieces by John Williams:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FVADOLRf54">Cantina Band #2</a> by Figrin D'an, from Star Wars, which plays in the background during Han's negotiation with Luke and Obi Wan</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ebjptd6Kgo">Lapti Nek</a> by Sy Snootles and The Max Rebo Band, from Return Of The Jedi, plays in Jabba's throne room</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VacG9L2Zkq8">Galactic Dance Blast</a>, never released on any soundtrack album, which the Max Rebo Band plays as background music on the sail barge</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ue_5T4fMk">Canto Bight</a>&rdquo; from the casino in The Last Jedi</li>
</ul>

<p>(Lapti Nek was replaced in the 1997 Special Edition release of Return Of The Jedi by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gnHu1M7jxs">Jedi Rocks</a>, written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Hey">Jerry Hey</a>.</p>
