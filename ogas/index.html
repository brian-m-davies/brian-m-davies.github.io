<h1>Oga&rsquo;s Cantina</h1>
<h2>Behind The Music</h2>
</div>
</div>



<div class="content">

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>If you're fascinated by who on Earth actually creates songs in the voices of jawas and droids, this is a compendium of information on the artists who created the music that plays in Oga's Cantina in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.

<hr/>

<p>Two of the producers of the music for Oga's Cantina were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-walker-4743111ba/"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a> Matt Walker, the executive in charge of music at Walt Disney Imagineering, and 
<a href="https://yaronspiwak.com/"><i class="fas fa-user"></i></a>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaron-spiwak-72496939/"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a>
Yaron Spiwak, a senior creative director at Walt Disney Imagineering.  The pair were interviewed by
<a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8528161/disneys-star-wars-galaxys-edge-cantina-music-album-playlist-one">Billboard</a> about the general strategy for the project.</p>

<p>They credit LucasFilm employees

Wood is a 5-time Academy Award nominee for sound editing, and also the voice of General Grievous and a few other characters.  Collins is the lead sound designer / voice director with the video game division of LucasArts and has done some acting and voice acting for them as well.</p>

<p>Matt Walker also hosted an hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWWm8kUK-nc">panel discussion at D23 Expo 2019</a> about the music, featuring singer Judith Hill, Disney Group songwriter Jason Mater, Matt Wood, and composer / producer Adam Dorn.</p>


<hr class="wide"/>

<h3>The Songs</h3>

<p>6 tracks were released as a preview on August 23, 2019, the day before the D23 Expo, and then the full "R3X's Playlist #1" with 18 tracks was released as a digital download on September 6, 2019.  The playlist is available for <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/star-wars-galaxys-edge-ogas-cantina-r3xs-playlist-1/1478016479">purchase</a>, and is also available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AydLFrcYNR8&list=PLiNVoBckLqLkZiHccDJk_lYiUrlESFO9z">YouTube</a> for the price of watching a few ads.</p>

<p>"The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey To Batuu" includes two radio stations, "DJ R-3X Stereo", and "Batuu Radio".  The former includes 2 songs, Blue Milk Surprise and Til The Spire, which are almost certainly used in Oga's Cantina.  The latter includes 6 songs, 3 of which are probably used in Oga's Cantina.  (The other 3 from "Batuu Radio" are not used in Oga's Cantina, and are covered later, in the section on ambient music.)</p>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4XckakuxnM">Til The Spire</a> by Tamir Muskat and Ori Kaplan</li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb3Wz6zXrss">Ti Lo Laka</a> by Beckerman Green & Douek</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, 3 more unreleased tracks, "R3X Opening Track", "Doolstan", and "Gaya" are available on the <a href="https://www.brewhousemusic.com/disneystarwarsdjr3xinogascan">Brewhouse Music site</a>.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=9bd673e4-fd11-46e4-ae7c-bc9b87200d53">L.A. Times article</a>, 29 songs were commissioned.  The 18 songs from the playlist, the 5 songs from The Sims, and the 3 songs from Brewhouse Music make 26, so there are likely a handful of Oga's Cantina songs still unreleased.</p>

Biola University Biography

Adam Gubman is a multimedia composer with a songsmith’s heart. He’s written melody-packed scores for feature films, theme park attractions, and more than 700 video games. He produced the smash anthem “This Is Me” from The Greatest Showman by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, which won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar and a Grammy. As a song producer, he’s lent his tune savviness to the films and television shows Baywatch, American Housewife, John Shaft, Ride Along, Galavant, The Smurfs, and Sausage Party, collaborating with composers such as Alan Menken, Aherns and Flaherty, Pasek and Paul, John Debney, and Christopher Lennertz.

In the gaming world, where he got his start on 2004’s Pirates of the Burning Sea, he’s run the gamut of genres with original score—and often original songs — for some of the biggest mobile games and publishing giants like Blizzard, Ubisoft, Sony Online Interactive, Electronic Arts, and Disney Online Interactive. He’s also created dozens of songs and arrangements for the magic-makers at Disney Imagineering for Disneyland, Disney World, and the Tokyo Disney properties, including Star Wars Galaxy Edge, Baymax Happy Ride and many more.

<h4>D. Victory on Ryloth</h4>

<p>The track in "The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey To Batuu" called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2fugqq5cXk">Victory on Ryloth</a> is very likely mislabeled.  There is a track by that name on the Clone Wars soundtrack, written by Kevin Kiner, during the scene where they are fighting on Ryloth, which is a completely different track.  We probably don't actually know the correct name or composer of this song.</p>

<h4>E. Ti Lo Laka</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb3Wz6zXrss">Ti Lo Laka</a> from "The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey To Batuu" is by Beckerman Green & Douek.  Beckerman is probably  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joelbeckerman"><i class="fab fa-facebook-square"></i></a> Joel Beckerman, since his company <a href="https://mademusicstudio.com">Made Music Studio</a> does other branding music for Disney.  Douek is probably <a href="http://joeldouek.com"><i class="fas fa-user"></i></a> Joel Douek.</p>

<p>Three of the tracks in "The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey To Batuu" are ambient music, which plays in the streets of Galaxy's Edge, not in Oga's Cantina.  The first two play in the marketplace, the third plays in the docking bay.</p>

<h3>Diagetic</h3>

<p>R3X's Playlist includes a remix of Cantina Band, the most recognizable of John Williams&rsquo; compositions for the Star Wars movies.  But that is just one of the many pieces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Star_Wars#Diegetic_music">diagetic music</a> in the movies.  There is plenty more where that came from.  There are 4 other pieces by John Williams:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FVADOLRf54">Cantina Band #2</a> by Figrin D'an, from Star Wars, which plays in the background during Han's negotiation with Luke and Obi Wan</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ebjptd6Kgo">Lapti Nek</a> by Sy Snootles and The Max Rebo Band, from Return Of The Jedi, plays in Jabba's throne room</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VacG9L2Zkq8">Galactic Dance Blast</a>, never released on any soundtrack album, which the Max Rebo Band plays as background music on the sail barge</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ue_5T4fMk">Canto Bight</a> from the casino in The Last Jedi</li>
</ul>

<p>(Lapti Nek was replaced in the 1997 Special Edition release of Return Of The Jedi by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gnHu1M7jxs">Jedi Rocks</a>, written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Hey">Jerry Hey</a>.)</p>

<p>For the sequel trilogy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin-Manuel_Miranda">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> was <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jabba_Flow#Behind_the_scenes">asked by J.J. Abrams</a> to produce several pieces of music.  The performer for all 3 of them is listed as Shag Kava.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eVfuzJcf8c">Jabba Flow</a> plays in The Force Awakens, as Han Solo, Finn, Rey, and BB-8 enter Maz Kanata's castle (Lin-Manuel Miranda has also done the song as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Sagk5uKEtQ">street performance</a>!)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdAD9VZta3o">Dobra Doompa</a> is also from The Force Awakens, but is not on the soundtrack; it plays later in Maz Kanata's castle</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca2SlCjDxUA">Lido Hey</a> is the song The Rise Of Skywalker during the festival of the ancestors; there's no clean recording of it available</li>
</ul>
