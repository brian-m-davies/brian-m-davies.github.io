<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that many of the minor parts in <i>Casablanca</i> were played by refugees from the Nazis, but the sheer number of refugees in the movie, and the specific details of their stories, still have the power to amaze.</p>

<p>Here are the tales of the guy whose dad sprung him from a concentration camp, the guy who went from standing up to Hitler to standing up to Joseph McCarthy, the refugee couple who met and got married on Warner Brothers&rsquo; previous anti-Nazi film, and the Russian Jew who fled into Germany to get away from the Communists...</p>

<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Veidt">Conrad Veidt</a></h2>
<h3>Major Heinrich Strasser</h3>
<p>A fervent anti-Nazi from Berlin, and a major star in Germany before the war.  In March 1933, Joseph Goebbels started purging &ldquo;undesirables&rdquo; from the German film industry. Veidt married his Jewish Hungarian fiancee Ilona Prager the following month. He was told if he divorced his wife and declared support for the Nazis, he could continue working. So a week after his wedding, he and his wife fled to England. He became a British citizen, and gave generously in Britain to help the war effort. He left for America in 1941 with the expressed purpose of making films to persuade America to join the war &mdash; his contract stipulated that if he played a Nazi, he must be portrayed as a villain.  Veidt died of a heart attack just months after the release of <i>Casablanca</i>.</p>

<h3>Victor Laszlo</h3>
<p>Born in Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father had converted from Judaism to Catholicism to avoid discrimination, but Henreid was rejected from working in German films anyway.  Henreid's anti-Nazi actions included helping a Jewish comedian friend escape Germany.  After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, he was formally designated an enemy of the Third Reich, and his assets were seized.  He fled to England with nothing. He was in danger of deportation when England declared war on Germany, but Conrad Veidt among others vouched for him.  He emigrated to the U.S. in 1940 and became an American citizen the following year. After the war he took a stand against McCarthyism, testifying against HUAC, and ended up on the Hollywood blacklist.</p>

<h3>Yvonne, Rick&rsquo;s discarded mistress</h3>

<p>Dalio was born Israel Moshe Blauschild to Romanian Jewish immigrants in Paris. He was a very well-known actor before the war, appearing in <i>The Rules Of The Game</i> by Jean Renoir and other major films of the period.  The Nazis used his face on anti-Jewish posters in France.</p>

<p>Dalio and Lebeau were married in 1939.  The couple fled from Paris to Lisbon in June 1940, just ahead of the German army.  Two months later, they purchased visas to Chile and set sail, but were stranded in Mexico when their visas turned out to be forgeries.  Lebeau spent the time in Mexico learning English.  The couple entered the U.S. on temporary Canadian passports.</p>

<p>They divorced in 1942, and returned to Paris separately to continue their careers after the war.  The rest of Dalio&rsquo;s family perished in the camps.</p>

He made one film for Alfred Hitchcock in Britain, learning much of his English dialogue phonetically.  He sailed for the U.S. in 1934, and became an American citizen in 1941.  He had a long and successful career in America after the war, and also made one film in West Germany in 1951.</p>

When Hungary also joined the Axis in 1940, he and his wife fled to Hollywood, where he had a long career.  He became an American citizen in 1946.

<p>St&ouml;ssel was Jewish, born in Lockenhaus, Hungary (now part of Austria). He left Germany for Austria when the Nazis took power in 1933. After the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938, he was imprisoned multiple times before escaping Vienna with his wife to Paris, and then to London. He did a couple of films in England before coming to America in 1939. He also performed in two later anti-Nazi films, <i>The Strange Death of Adolf Hitler</i> (1943) and <i>Hitler&rsquo;s Madman</i> (1943).</p>

<p>Gr&uuml;ning was Jewish, born in Vienna, Austria. She was the head of a major acting school in Berlin. She fled Germany for Paris in 1938, and then sailed to New York in February 1939. After the war, she tried returning to Germany, but came back to America after just a couple of years.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;Will you ask Rick if he will have a drink with us?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Gertrude Berliner was born to a Jewish family in Berlin, where she became a famous cabaret performer in the 1920s.  After a few small roles, her film work took off in 1928, and she appeared in dozens of films in the next 5 years (including four with S. Z. Sakall) but her career was cut short in 1933 when the Nazis took power.  She fled Germany and settled in the Netherlands, where she married the Swiss painter Max Schoop in 1939, but was forced to flee again when the Nazis occupied the Netherlands in 1940.  The couple came to America via Lisbon, just like in the movie.  She tried to resume her career in Hollywood, but only got a handful of bit parts, and ended up giving up acting altogether.</p>

<h3>the woman selling her diamonds</h3>

<p>Zilzer&rsquo;s father was a Jewish actor from Germany.  He was working in America in 1901, and so Wolfgang was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. They returned to Germany after the death of Zilzer&rsquo;s mother when Wolfgang was only 4.  After Hitler&rsquo;s rise to power, he fled to France, then returned to Germany in 1935, before leaving for the U.S. in 1937. Upon arriving, he was surprised to discover he already had U.S. citizenship. He appeared in anti-Nazi films in America under the pseudonyms John Voight and Paul Andor to protect his father back in Berlin.  However the Gestapo interrogated his father in 1943, showing him a picture of his son from the anti-Nazi film <i>Confessions Of A Nazi Spy</i>, and his father died shortly afterwards under mysterious circumstances.</p>

<p>Andor was also Jewish, born Lotte Mosbacher in Bochum, Germany. She married film editor Viktor Palfi, and the couple fled to the U.S. via France and Spain in 1934, after the Nazis came to power. They could not find work and separated. Her mother died in 1942 in the Litzmannstadt ghetto.</p>

<p>Zilzer and Mosbacher met and fell in love on the set of <i>Confessions Of A Nazi Spy</i> in 1939, and then worked together again on <i>Casablanca</i>.</p>

<p>Zilzer worked in both America and Germany after the war, including a recurring role on <i>Late Night With David Letterman</i>.  When Zilzer fell ill in the late 1980s, he decided to return to Germany; Andor refused to join him, and the couple divorced.  Both died soon after.</p>
